## Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on my honours in mathematics at the University of Cape Town. Seperate from that, I'm trying to learn the finer details of Rust, and tackling Advent of Code problems to do so. I'm also working on a chess engine on the side and do a bit of competitive programming when I get the chance.
