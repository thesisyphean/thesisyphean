## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ethan. By day, I'm working on an honours in mathematics. By night, I'm also working on it, but I try to fit in some programming as well.

I'm currently trying to learn the finer details of Rust, and tackling Advent of Code problems to do so. On the side, I'm working on a chess engine and do a bit of competitive programming when I get the chance.
